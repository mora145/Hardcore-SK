  <description>Allows you to recruit visitors. At a price, of course. 

You can also improve your relationship with visiting factions and sell items to visiting guests. Guests will buy and use things inside of their allowed area.


Errors and bugs: If you get errors, most likely Hospitality is clashing with another mod you're using.

So to help me fix bugs, please describe clearly what happened. I also need a log. You create it by pressing Ctrl-F12 after you get an error or the problem first occurs. You'll get a link that you can post with your description.

Hospitality requires the HugsLib mod to be loaded first. Hospitality should be loaded as late as possible in the load order.
