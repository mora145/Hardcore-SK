	<description>This mod adds some robots to buy from traders:

- Haulingbot
     A small drone to help you hauling stuff around
- Cleaningbot
     A small robot to help keeping your home clean  
	

Hints:
- The robots here can only be bought, not crafted.
- You can assign them to an area by clicking on the area name in the robot info panel. (Animal zone!)
- Before a fight you are encouraged to recall the robots so they don't accidently wander into the fight area.

	
Hint for the load order:
1st: Try the defined load order. 
--> If robots still make problems, move Misc. Robots and Misc. Robots++ at the END of your mod list
Core
...
Misc. Core (Not needed if you only use Misc. Robots)
Misc. ... (--> other Miscellaneous Mods)
Misc. Robots
Misc. Robots++ / other mod depending on Misc. Robots
...
