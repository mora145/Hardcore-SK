  <description>Based on Realistic Darkness mod by Helpful Bot.
  You can choose in mod option level of darkness: Vanilla like, Darkness Lite, Realistic darkness.
  Tired of not being able to tell whether its day or night because they both look similar? Ever wanted lighting to matter? Well then this is for you.
  This mod changes lighting and saturation in rimworld to be dynamically darker. Also changes colors and saturation of weather patterns and the eclipse event along the same lines.
